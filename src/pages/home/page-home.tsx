      <p>
        The Sakila sample database was initially developed by Mike Hillyer, a
        former member of the MySQL AB documentation team. It is intended to
        provide a standard schema that can be used for examples in books,
        tutorials, articles, samples, and so forth. The Sakila sample database
        also serves to highlight features of MySQL such as Views, Stored
        Procedures, and Triggers.
